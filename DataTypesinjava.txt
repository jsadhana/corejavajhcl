Primitive Data Types in Java 
A. Byte

    Byte data type is a 8-bit signed two's complement integer
    Minimum value is : -128 (-2^7)
    Maximum value is : 127 (inclusive)(2^7 -1)
    Default value is : 0
    Byte data type is used to save space in large arrays, mainly in place of integers, since a byte is four times smaller than an int
B. Short

    Short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer
    Minimum value is : -32,768 (-2^15)
    Maximum value is : 32,767(inclusive) (2^15 -1)
    Default value is : 0
    Short data type can also be used to save memory as byte data type. A short is 2 times smaller than an int

C. Int

    Int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer
    Minimum value is : -2,147,483,648.(-2^31)
    Maximum value is : 2,147,483,647(inclusive).(2^31 -1)
    Default value is : 0
    Int is generally used as the default data type for integral values unless there is a concern about memory

D. Long

    Long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer
    Minimum value is : -9,223,372,036,854,775,808.(-2^63)
    Maximum value is : 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive). (2^63 -1)
    Default value is : 0L
    This type is used when a wider range than int is needed

E. Float

    Float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point
    Default value is : 0.0f
    Float data type is never used for precise values such as currency
    Float is mainly used to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers


F. Double

    double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
    Default value is : 0.0d
    Double data type should never be used for precise values such as currency
    This data type is generally used as the default data type for decimal values. generally the default choice

Syntax :

double Variable_Name = Value;

G. Boolean

    boolean data type represents one bit of information
    There are only two possible values : true and false
    This data type is used for simple flags that track true/false conditions
    Default value is : false

Syntax :

boolean Variable_Name = Value (true/false);

H. Char

    char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character
    Minimum value is : '\u0000' (or 0)
    Maximum value is : '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive)
    Char data type is used to store any character

Syntax :

char Variable_Name = Value;
